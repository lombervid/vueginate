# Contributing

I'm really excited that you are interested in contributing. Before submitting your contribution, please make sure to take a moment and read through the following guidelines:

- Make sure to follow our code style.

## Creating issues

### Bug reports

Always try to provide as much information as possible. If you are reporting a bug, try to provide a repro on jsfiddle.net (or anything else) or a stacktrace at the very least. This will help us check the problem quicker.

### Feature requests

Lay out the reasoning behind it and propose an API for it. Ideally, you should have a practical example to prove the utility of the feature you're requesting.
